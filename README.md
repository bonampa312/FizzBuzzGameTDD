The game consists in tapping the right button according to the next number of the one displayed in the left upper side of the center buttons. 

If the next number is divisible by 3, the 'Fizz' button (wine bottle) must be tapped.
If the next number is divisible by 5, the 'Buzz' button (lightning) must be tapped.
If the next number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the 'FizzBuzz' button (space ship) must be tapped.
If the next number is not divisible either by 3 or 5, the number button (with the actual score) must be tapped.
